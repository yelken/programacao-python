# Arithmetic expressions - numbers, operators, expressions
# Integer vs. Regular division


# Regular division - includes fractional part
# Single division sign
# Used to get exact values

# Ex. 1 What is one third of thirty-two?
print "Ex. 1:", 32.0 / 3.0

# Ex. 2 What is 19 / 24 as a percentage?
print "Ex. 2:", (19.0 / 24.0) * 100, "%"

# Ex. 3 What is the average of 3, 5, 17, and 29?
print "Ex. 3:",(3 + 5 + 17 + 29) / 4.0


print "--------"
# Integer division - rounds down to nearest whole number (floor function)
# Double division sign
# Works the same with integers, but used to get whole numbers from floats

# Ex. 4 If there are 6 triangles in a hexagon, how many complete
#     hexagons can be made with 27 triangles?
print "Ex. 4:", 27 // 6.0

# Ex. 5 If 20 people can fit on each bus, how many full busses
#    will there be if 59 people are riding in busses?
print "Ex. 5:", 59 // 20.0

# Ex. 6 If Dan can eat one hotdog in 16 seconds, how many
#    whole hotdogs can he eat in 3 minutes?
print "Ex. 6:", (3 * 60) // 16.0


print "--------"
# Try changing the number of division signs in the 
#     problems above to test it out for yourself!


# Note: Integer division is not always the same as 
#    converting a float to an integer - they round the
#    opposite directions when the result is a negative number
print "Same:", 6.0 // 5.0, int(6.0 / 5.0)
print "Same:", 0.0 // 3.0, int(0.0 / 3.0)
print "Different:", -7.0 // 4.0, int(-7.0 / 4.0)


print "--------"
# Warning: Do not divide by 0. It is not allowed in regular
#    math, nor is it allowed in Codeskulptor.
#print "Error:", 3 // 0
#print "Error:", 3 / 0

# It is important to make sure that division by zero does
#    not occur. The error you get can cause your game or 
#    program to end prematurely. Be especially careful when 
#    the denominator of a fraction is an arithmetic expression
#    or a changing variable.
# For example:
#print "Error:", 4 / (3 * 4 - 12)

# Although the division by zero is not obvious at first, it
#    can still kill your program. Make it a habit to always
#    check for this possibility whenever you use division.
