# Comments, strings and print

# Did you notice that these words are orange? Any words after
#    a number/pound sign on the same line are called comments.
#    Comments are lines of code that the computer does not
#    look at. These can be used to clarify the purpose of your
#    code and make it easier to read.

# A string is a collection of characters enclosed by quotation
#    marks or apostrophes. Notice that strings are red instead
#    of orange.

print "This is a string"
print 'This is also a string'

# To print these strings and other things to the box on the
#    right, the word print is used.

print "Output Number One"
print 'Output Number Two'

# print statements on their own can be used to print blank
#    lines to the screen, which separates output and makes it
#    easier to read. 

print
print "Hello"
print

# Multiple strings can be printed on the same line by using
#    commas to separate them. This automatically inserts a 
#    space in between the two strings.

print "One", "Two"
print "One", "Two", "Three"
print

# If you want to include a quotation mark or apostrophe in
#    your string, you need to make the symbols around the 
#    string be the opposite type.

print "You're awesome!"
print '"Thank you!" I replied.'

# If you accidentally use the same ones, errors can occur.
#    Notice that not all of the words are red in the following
#    examples; that is a big clue that something is wrong.
#    To see what errors you can get, uncomment the lines
#    below by deleting the '#' mark at the beginning of the
#    line, and then try running the program.

#print 'It's mine'
#print "I said "hi" to him"

# You can also get an error by misspelling 'print.' Notice
#    that again, print shows up as a different color than 
#    normal.

#prit "Error"
#printer "Error"

# Congratulations!!! You are off to a great start :)
